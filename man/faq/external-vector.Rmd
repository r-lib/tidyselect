## Ambiguity between columns and external variables

With selecting functions like `dplyr::select()` or `tidyr::pivot_longer()`,
you can refer to variables by name:

```{r}
mtcars %>% select(cyl, am, vs)

mtcars %>% select(mpg:disp)
```

For historical reasons, it is also possible to refer an external
vector of variable names. You get the correct result, but with a
warning informing you that selecting with an external variable is
ambiguous because it is not clear whether you want a data frame column
or an external object.

```{r}
vars <- c("cyl", "am", "vs")
result <- mtcars %>% select(vars)
```

We have decided to deprecate this particular approach to using
external vectors because they introduce ambiguity. Imagine that the
data frame contains a column with the same name as your external
variable.

```{r}
some_df <- mtcars[1:4, ]
some_df$vars <- 1:nrow(some_df)
```

These are very different objects but it isn't a problem if the context
forces you to be specific about where to find `vars`:

```{r}
vars

some_df$vars
```

In a selection context however, the column wins:

```{r}
some_df %>% select(vars)
```


## Fixing the ambiguity

To make your selection code more robust and silence the message, use
`all_of()` to force the external vector:

```{r}
some_df %>% select(all_of(vars))
```
